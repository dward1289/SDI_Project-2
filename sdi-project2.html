<p>Jay-Z, Drake, and J Cole are some of my favorite rappers. If they really did have a concert
together, I would definitely attend. I created a script based on my dream concert. Each artist
is introduced to the stage, and their time is being counted in sets of 15. The total crowd was
calculated as 120,000 people per singer. It was a full house. Everyone had a great time,
and everyone enjoyed the artists.</p>
